# Taskar
My hello-world for Golang. Currently only does unconstrained numerical optimization, specifically quasi-newton LBFGS. 

## Running tests
- Install Golang coverage tool:` go get code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/cover`

 - Install the great  `goconvey` testing library:` go get github.com/smartystreets/goconvey`

- Run goconvey test server :` $GOPATH/bin/goconvey`

- Open `http://localhost:8080/` to see test results live update as you edit code
